    "name": "Lemon Salmon with Potato Gratin",
    "description": "This dish is truly amazing in every sense! After assembly, the potato gratin gets a head start in the oven while the salmon gets marinating in lemon and garlic. You then top the half-roasted fish fillets on top, and as the salmon cooks, the delicious juices seep down into the creamy, cheesy layers of potato below, working all kinds of mouthwatering magic. By the time the gratin is done, the fish is perfectly cooked. And as if the sheer convenience of two dishes in one wasn’t enough, the recipe makes more gratin than you need. So you’ll have lunch leftovers to fight over the next day. Didn’t I say amazing?\n\nNOTES\n1 Any thick fish fillets similar in size to salmon will also work. Don’t worry if your salmon has skin; leave it on for cooking, then just eat the flesh off the skin if you don’t want to eat it.\n2 Or other all-purpose or starchy potatoes. Waxy potatoes are not recommended.\n3 Any good melting cheese will work here, but stronger varieties bring the best flavour for gratin! Colby, Swiss and cheddar are all suitable alternatives. (Using mozzarella, mix it in with ½ cup (30 g) of finely grated parmesan for extra flavour.)\n4 If you don’t have a garlic crusher, finely mince the garlic, then mash into a paste with the side of a knife.\n5 After resting, the internal temperature will rise from 50°C to 53°C, which is medium-rare (or optimum juiciness). This is the default doneness at which restaurants serve salmon. For medium, target an internal temperature of 60°C, which will rise to 63°C after resting—still juicy, but it will be juicier if medium-rare (You can tell which camp I’m in …).\n\nLEFTOVERS Fridge 3 days, freezer 3 months.",
