    "description": "Over the years I’ve become an enthusiastic fan of cooking pasta directly in sauce. It’s a brilliant shortcut. Not only does it save on washing up, but the starch from the pasta naturally thickens the sauce while absorbing the tasty flavours as it cooks. This pot is bursting with tasty, garlicky tomato flavours and Italian mixed herbs. A handful of fresh basil is a great finishing touch but by no means essential. Chicken wins my protein pick here for its fast and easy cooking, and because I think chicken goes with just about any pasta sauce. Yes, it’s true that Italians traditionally don’t mix chicken and pasta, but the rest of the world thinks it’s a completely delicious combo, so the Italians should really get on board!",

      "CHICKEN",
      "500 g boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into thin strips (about 1 x 4 cm)",
      "½ tsp cooking salt",
      "¼ tsp black pepper",
      "2 tsp Italian mixed herbs",
      "2 tbsp olive oil",
      "PASTA AND SAUCE",
      "1 brown onion, finely chopped",
      "3 garlic cloves, finely minced",
      "3 tbsp tomato paste",
      "½ cup (80 ml) ordinary water or dry white wine (optional)",
      "400 g can crushed tomatoes",
      "4 cups (1 litre) low-salt chicken stock",
      "½ tsp white sugar, if needed",
      "½ tsp cooking salt",
      "½ tsp black pepper",
      "3 cups (345 g) penne (or other similar-sized pasta)",
      "1 cup (100 g) shredded cheddar*",
      "TO SERVE",
      "Finely grated parmesan*",
      "Handful of basil leaves (optional)"

Add the chicken and cook until the surface changes from pink to white, but is still raw inside. Transfer to a bowl using a slotted spoon, leaving the fat behind in the pot."

        "@type": "HowToStep",
        "text": "Make sauce – In the same pot, cook the onion and garlic for 2 minutes. Add the tomato paste and stir for 1 minute. Add the wine (if using) and let it simmer rapidly for 2 minutes, stirring, to scrape the pot until it’s mostly evaporated. Add the tomatoes, stock, sugar (if using), salt and pepper. Stir, then once the sauce comes to a simmer, add the pasta and return the cooked chicken to the pot (along with any juices pooled on the plate). Stir, then reduce the heat to medium–high so the sauce is bubbling energetically but not rapidly boiling."
      },
      {
        "@type": "HowToStep",
        "text": "Cook pasta – Cook for 10 minutes, stirring regularly so the pasta cooks evenly. Towards the end, as the sauce starts to thicken, reduce the heat to medium–low and stir more regularly so the base doesn’t catch. Once the penne is tender (pick one out to check), remove the pot from the stove. It should still be more watery than you expect – the liquid will be absorbed in the next step. Add the cheese and stir it through."

      {
        "@type": "HowToStep",
        "text": "Rest and serve – Leave the pasta to rest for 3 minutes. The cheese will melt and the excess liquid will be absorbed by the pasta. Serve, topped with parmesan and a good handful of basil (if using)."

    "recipeNotes": [
      "Boneless, skinless chicken breast also works but will not be as juicy as thighs.",
      "Use your everyday Italian herb mix from regular grocery stores. Substitute with a mix of dried parsley, basil and oregano (equal quantities).",
      "Not all canned tomatoes are created equal. Economical brands tend to be on the sour side so adding a touch of sugar is recommended. If you’re using good-quality tomatoes, you won’t need the sugar.",
      "Or other melting cheese of choice, such as tasty cheese, colby or monterey jack. Mozzarella isn’t recommended as it doesn’t add flavour. If you do use it, add an extra ½ cup (50 g) of grated parmesan.",
      "LEFTOVERS: Fridge 3 days, freezer 3 months."
