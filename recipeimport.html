    "description": "My trick for packing as much spice and flavour as possible onto baked chicken? Coat it with something wet first so it sticks even better! I like to use either a sticky glaze (like Sticky Soy Chicken with Sesame Broccolini on page 193) or yoghurt. Here I'm using the technique for an Arab-inspired chicken and vegetable tray bake. My spice mix is loosely based on zaatar - I just love the earthy, herbal flavours of this Middle Eastern spice blend. One tip: Don't skip the sumac here! This tangy red spice tastes a bit like lemon in powder form. It both lifts the dish and gives it an authentic edge.\n\nNOTES:\n1. Bone-in, skin-on thighs are best as they will stay juicy with the bake time required to cook the potato and carrots. Drumsticks work well too - use 6-8. However, to use boneless, skinless breast and thighs, roast the vegetables alone for 20 minutes, then add the chicken breast or thighs and roast for a further 20 minutes. Finish with a 5-minute blast under the oven grill to get some colour on the chicken.\n2. Any potatoes will work for this recipe, large or small, waxy or floury. Just be sure to cut them fairly thinly so they cook through. My default are all-rounders like sebago potatoes - the dirty, brushed ones you see 'everywhere' in Australia.\n3. Or regular carrots, peeled, then cut into 10 cm long batons about 1.5 cm wide.\n4. Sumac is a wonderful Middle Eastern spice with a lemony flavour and vibrant red colour. Find it in large grocery stores, priced the same as other spices. It's a key ingredient in this recipe so it's worth getting! Substitute with paprika and finish the dish with a good squeeze of fresh lemon just before serving.\nLEFTOVERS: Fridge 3 days, freezer 3 months.",
